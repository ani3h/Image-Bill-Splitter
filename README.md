# Image Bill Splitter
This project implements a Computer Vision-based Image Bill Splitter that automatically identifies and processes receipts or bills from images. By leveraging image recognition techniques, the application detects text, extracts itemized details, and applies an intuitive interface to split costs among users. It offers an efficient way to handle group payments by scanning bills, parsing data, and distributing expenses fairly.

Key features include:

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images.
- Itemization of bill components.
- Simple user interface for splitting costs among multiple people.
- Error handling for incomplete or unclear data.
- This project is ideal for streamlining group payments during outings, trips, or events.
